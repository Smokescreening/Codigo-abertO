Simple visualization on Google Maps from Slack data.

## Instructions

You need to get an API token from Slack to get this working. If you are a member of the Slack group you can get it by visiting their [API page][slack_api_docs]. The token must then be pasted into a file `.env` to be placed at the root of the directory. The contents should be of the form:

`TOKEN='<the-token-from-slack>'`
